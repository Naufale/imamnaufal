## Experiences

- **FISHTION: Fish Auction Startup Idea**
- Description: Fishtion is a startup that aims to revolutionize the fisheries industry with a modernized buying and selling system, bridging the auction system and providing convenience for fishermen and consumers. As the team leader, I led the initiation of the idea, and despite challenges, we achieved recognition in the top five best scores during the Acceleration Bootcamp, setting us on a path to transform the industry.
- Technologies used: BMC, pitch deck

- **BEM SB 2020/2021 WEBSITE**
- Description: Due to a request from BEM SB, I took on the responsibility of joining the website project as a web developer, working alongside the Media and Branding Division. Initially, I planned to create the website using raw HTML and CSS, which I had learned at Prograte Bootcamp. However, my university provided a server linked to WordPress, so I had to adapt and create the website using WordPress. Although I faced challenges due to my lack of experience with WordPress, I eventually completed the website in about 4 months. Thanks to the knowledge gained from Prograte Bootcamp and the Elementor Pro plugin, I was able to overcome obstacles and create an advanced website for the project.
- Technologies used: Wordpress, HTML, CSS

- **INDONESIAN ROBOT CONTEST 2022**
- Description: My team is participating in the Indonesian Robot Contest 2022 for university students, competing in the Search and Rescue (SAR) Robot category. We prepared a successful proposal together and started building the robot with divisions in Programming, Mechanic, and Hardware. In the Hardware division, I ensure the electrical circuits function well as needed, creating schematics using Autodesk Eagle for the upgraded components. This year, we are also using PCB for the first time, requiring additional learning time, but we continue to make progress while waiting for other improvements to be completed.
- Technologies used: Eagle, Arduino

- **Broadcast Engineering**
- Description: Starting as an IT staff during the MPKMB at IPB University, I learned how to stream events online due to Covid-19. As a switcher operator, I took responsibility for operating the switcher camera during the event. Subsequently, I had opportunities to be a streaming vendor for various events, gaining experience as a Central Operator, Technical Director, Director of Photography, and Camera Person. Despite facing challenges like hardware and software issues, insufficient briefing time, and more, these experiences have taught me valuable skills in handling streaming for various occasions.
- Technologies used: VMIX, OBS, Audio Mixer, Videotron, Multicam, Transmitter, Intercom, Switcher

- **GRAPHIC DESIGN**
- Description: For video editing, I use Adobe Premiere Pro for sequence editing and adjustments, and After Effects for motion creation. Overcoming the initial challenge of learning the software, I found tutorials and hands-on practice helpful. In graphic design, I rely on Adobe Illustrator for offline work and Figma for collaborations. To spark creativity, I seek inspiration from veteran designers' projects rather than spending excessive time searching for ideas.
- Technologies used: Adobe Illustator, Adobe Photoshop, Figma, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects
